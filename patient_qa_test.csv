What are the causes of acute kidney injury?,"Most cases of acute kidney injury are caused by reduced blood flow to the kidneys, usually in someone who's already unwell with another health condition. This reduced blood flow could be caused by low blood volume after bleeding, excessive vomiting or diarrhea, or severe dehydration, among other factors. AKI can also be caused by problems with the kidney itself, such as inflammation of the filters, blood vessels or other structures in the kidney. This may be caused by a reaction to some medicines, infections or the liquid dye used in some types of X-rays.",acute kidney injury,https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/acute-kidney-injury/

You may need to increase your intake of water and other fluids if you're dehydrated, antibiotics if you have an infection, or stop taking certain medicines at least until the problem is sorted. A urinary catheter, a thin tube used to drain the bladder if there's a blockage, may be inserted. Most people with AKI make a full recovery, but some go on to develop chronic kidney disease or long-term kidney failure. In severe cases, dialysis may be needed.",acute kidney injury,https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/acute-kidney-injury/

What are the medicines that can cause acute kidney injury?,"Certain medicines can increase the risk of AKI, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), such as ibuprofen or blood pressure medicines, such as ACE inhibitors or diuretics. Diuretics help the kidneys get rid of extra fluid from the body, but they may become less helpful when a person is dehydrated or suffering from a severe illness. Aminoglycosides, a type of antibiotic that's usually given only in hospital, are only likely to increase the risk of AKI if you're dehydrated or ill.",acute kidney injury,https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/acute-kidney-injury/
How can acute kidney injury be prevented?,"Those at risk of AKI should be monitored with regular blood tests if they become unwell or start new medicine. It's also useful to check how much pee you're passing. Any warning signs of AKI, such as vomiting or producing little pee, require immediate investigation for AKI and treatment. People who are dehydrated or at risk of dehydration may need to be given fluids through a drip, and any medicine that seems to be making the problem worse or directly damaging the kidneys needs to be stopped, at least temporarily.",acute kidney injury,https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/acute-kidney-injury/
